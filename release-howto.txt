 idx commons - how to release
=========================================

Sonatype JIRA ticket:
https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-32727

Releasing instructions:
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html

A) Releasing snapshot versions

   Release the snapshot artefacts (signed archives and Javadoc) to the snapshot repository:

   gradle -Prelease uploadArchives
   
   The snapshot versions will then appear under
   https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ch/frostnova/
   
   
A) Releasing versions

1. Change the project version (build.gradle) to a release. Naming conventions:
	- beta versions: 'a.b.c-BETA-n'
	- release candidates: 'a.b.c-RC-n'
	- final versions: 'a.b.c' or 'a.b.c-FINAL'
   
2. Release the snapshot artefacts (signed archives and Javadoc):

   gradle -Prelease uploadArchives
   
   Afterwards, change the project version (build.gradle) back to a SNAPSHOT version.
   
3. Login to Nexus
   https://oss.sonatype.org
   
4. Within Nexus, select 'Build Promotion' > 'Staging Repositories'
   In the list, select your repository (group id + number, e.g. 'chfrostnova-1001')
   Check the content of the repository (versions, contents).
   
5. Close the repository (action in the toolbar in Nexus).
   This will trigger the checks on the repository to be performed
   (see http://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html) and will take some time.
   You can track the closing activity under the 'Activity' tab, where you will also see the 
   individual steps, and in the end 'Repository closed'.
   
6. If the checks fail (or you don't want to release anyway), 'Drop' the repository (action in the toolbar).
   This will remove the staging repository without releasing.
   
7. If the checks are ok, you can 'Release' the staging repository (action in the toolbar).
   This will move the artefacts to the release repository, where it will be synched with the centeral repository.
